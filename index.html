                  <p class="whoami">I am Melvin, an eightteen years old graphic designer who lives in Elst, a place next to Arnhem in the Netherlands. My main skill is logo, 2D and advertisments design. I also like to photography and film, I mainly do this for school projects or for myself. Of course we are trying to improve ourselfs, I am busy trying my best with photo manipulation.</p>

                     <span class="title">HOW I STARTED WITH DESIGNING.</span>
                     It all began as a hobby, I started designing YouTube banners for a friend of mine who had a channel and need a banner, avatar and some thumbnails. I started improving myself in designing banners for Youtubers and became populair and I was getting orders, from that moment I started to design for money.

                  <p class="future">
                     <span class="title">WHAT ARE MY FUTURE PLANS?</span>
                     I am currently in school and follow the education Media design. At the moment I am in first grade of my study and I have three more years to go. During school I would like to invest much time as I can in our starting company, so when I am graduated I could spend my knowledge and time in design and enterprise.
